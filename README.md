# Party Ready Check


When in a ToB or ToA party, type "R" in any chat visible to your party.

This will mark you as ready (indicated with an R) in the party frame.

To undo your ready status, you can type "UN R" in any chat visible to your party.

Note that desync will occur if you type "R" or "UN R" in a chat that only you or a few members of your party can see.

For example, if only 3/5 of your party is in the same clan and you type "R", only those 3 players will see you as Ready.


Custom notification sounds can also be used. See the plugin options menu in Runelite for more info.
